Love this game, played it in computer class in the 90s. 
It's an oldie but a goodie! A little difficult when you're young and don't understand the resources or hunting interface, but otherwise good!
Brought back some memories!
game was great 
  
I played Oregon trail in elementary school. 
Disliked that you couldn't sell at the stores, can only buy, so no opportunity to reallocate things you bought too much of at beginning of trip and trade it in for things you needed further into the game. For example, I would have bought fewer clothes and more food. 
great
I don't think middle school aged students would like the game. They would be bored.
It was pretty boring. 
Game is old and dated. Haven't played since grade school.
No
This game is so old, I have been playing this game since 1995 and I am sure that these games have been around before then. 
Its an oldie by a goodie
I thinks the game could be interesting for kids.
Classic game!
