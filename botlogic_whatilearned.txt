Not too much
IT WAS EDUCATIONAL BUT IT DIDNT PROVIDE NEW INFO
Nothing, but I only paid the first 5 levels.
There was no middle ground on the choices. Like something between agree and disagree.
Some problem-solving through obstacles.
How to spell words
Its basic counting steps and finding the shortest path the reach a destination while also mainting enough battery life to get you to the destination, so you have to try to get to more than 1 destination within the game and to also make sure you collect enough resources to get you to the first destination and then to the second destination (or more destinations as it progresses)
It's fun and easy to play
I learned how to type in my moves instead of using the mouse. I also learned to plan out the best possible moves before taking any action.
building instruction code, algorithmically in a simple way.
Its is a problem solving skill trying to navigate an object through obstacles with the most direct route. So you learn efficiency and some rudimentary programing.
Never to play it again
I learned that playing this game is a little difficult.  Its a good game for some one that is wanting to know stratetgy
That there are many was to get to the goal
Not much, maybe some very basic programming, it was a pretty straight forward game. Some of the later levels were fun though.
Kinda annoying 
I was unable to understand how to play and when I tried to read the tutorials, they would not come up
the game erred out and would not complete the first level
hand eye coordination
Nothing
nothing
boring
I didn't learn anything, but a young child may learn counting, spatial reasoning.
I didn't learn anything.
Nothing really
Different coding procedures.
You learn how to navigate and problem solve, but it was so low level for my age that it was easy and I did it easily 
I learned that it is good 
Extremely basic programming skills. It reminded me of that one program we used in the 90s with the turtle, telling it how to move on screen
