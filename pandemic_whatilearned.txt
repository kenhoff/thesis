How a virus can spread faster in waterborne and wipe out a whole population in no time.
Basic knowledge of how viruses and bacterium move throughout the world is learned, but the game mechanics are very simple, so you don't get much detailed information.
Learned about diseases and them spreading

How Quickly disease can spread

GREAT SURVEY
Different diseases
Some questions have relation to the game 
I learned that something can spread easily throughout the world creating a pandemic.
How diseases can so very easily be spread throughout the world by just an airplane. You also have to contemplate the best way to grow your disease. Should you focus on the lethality of it or the resistance of it? There are many options to contemplate when trying to develop the best disease.
This game has the potential to teach models of disease, but it feels more "gamey" than educational.
