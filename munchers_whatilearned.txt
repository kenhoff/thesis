I really didn't learn anything that I didn't already know, but maybe that's because I'm 45 and the grade level only went to 12
I learned nothing from playing this game.
I already know multiples in this game number munchers, it is a good concept but it really doesn't hold my attention and the music can be a bit distracting..this is music you would hear if you were playing a educational game that involves action of some sort.
The Survey was a fair length and very pleasurable
I like the game

asked same question over and over
i'm slow at math without a calculator
13 is not a factor of 88

terminology was confusing in the questions about the game.
This survey was interesting it's like being in school again.

the survey was great quick and easy to decipher and did not take that long
Nice survey. I hope yr interested in building good games. 
I learned math.
Read directions before you start!  Review of math skills.
Some of the questions were asked more than once but in a different way I thought that was clever.
