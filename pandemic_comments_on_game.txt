Very fun game and enjoyed playing it very much. It really teaches you how fast a germ can spread in so many different ways.
Fun to play as the "bad guy/disease" for a change.
Interesting subject to base a game on
It was okay. I find it hard to get started
not my type of game
I've played similar games before.  They are very addicting.  The graphics were much better in this version.
i think this game is pretty boring. it is educational in the sense it show how disease is spread.i think more graphic interaction could be cool.Maybe some little movies to show progress.
I never play game like this before, I loved it
GREAT GAME
Very hard game, but fun 
A little slow but otherwise interesting
The game was fun; however, there should be some more options during game play. Starting points where the virus starts, visuals showing the paths the virus is going, and maybe even adding anti cheat into it.
I would prefer the tutorial being in game because it makes it easier to start gameplay sooner, especially for people who don't like having to follow a lot of instructions to finally figure out how to play the game.
As I stated before, it does a decent job of simulating disease transmission and shows the effects various disease properties might have for the purpose of transmission. It feels more like a game than an educational tool, but I suppose that's the point.
A lot of action and good graphics
THis game is 8 out of 10
dECENT GAME. WILL REMEBER SITE
Didn't think I would have as much fun infecting people
SLOW, HARD TO GAIN POINTS TO UNLOCK ITEMS
great
Great game, a lot of fun for what it is. Could be expanded.
Game was fun. Knowing why I stopped getting evolution points would have been nice, though.
Could be a faster pace game. Kind of slow going.
Very boring. 
Pretty fun, I like the wiping out people.
good game.
