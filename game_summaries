Darfur is Dying
http://www.darfurisdying.com/
Darfur is Dying, developed by mtvU, is a flash-based game released in April of 2006. The game consists of two main sections. In the first section, players must select a member of a Darfuri refugee; the family consists of a male, female, and several children. Once the player has chosen, the player must guide the refugee to a well using only compass and distance directions, while attempting to avoid Janjaweed militia patrols in trucks. If the player is caught, the game describes the fate of the refugee, and the player is prompted to select another refugee. Once the player has made it to the well, the player must return through the same section to their encampment, but lose water during their journey. Once they have returned to the encampment, the player enters a top-down strategy-like game simulation; they can use the water they have retrieved to grow crops and keep the encampment in good condition. However, if they run out of water, they will need to return to the first section and make the well run again. The goal of the game is to keep the encampment alive for 7 days. In addition, the community is constantly under threat from attacks from the militia; if the militia attacks, the encampment is lost, and the player must start again. The player can prevent attacks from the militia by participating in various viral and advocacy campaign tactics, such as inviting their friends to play, posting on social media, or writing to government officials.
