How to add two numbers together
nothing
it was simple
nothing
I refreshed my basic math skills.
Intresting
nothing
The game was a basic math review.
I didn't learn anything, It's mainly just quick thinking, it's good for the brain though!
This game helped with math. I learned that there are ways that math can be fun for kids. 
I learned nothing. I already know how to add.
It was math baseball; so I ripped through about 50 home runs before getting tired of it. I would say didn't learn anything.
this game hits all aspects of educational fun, im even going to have my six year old son play this game from now on its really cool. it teaches you how to multiply, measure objects to throw, concentration . really cool
my mathematical abilities/skills are still good
If I was not good at simple arithmetic this game would have been helpful in learning addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
math
nothing!
more interesting then the game
I already know the math presented here. This game seems like it would be more educational for a young person who is learning math.
Nothing much.
Some basic algebra and arithmetic 
Nothing, but the math was elementary to me
Educational games can really suck
Nothing
that my 7 year old would probably get a kick out of this game and that it would help his math skills
I didn't learn anything. They were math problems I have seen
GOOD LEGNTH
