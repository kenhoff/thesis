it doesn't feel like a game, more like work. incredibly difficult, not fun at all.
I really thought it was kind of dumb. Every time I clicked on something a message box would pop up. It was very annoying.
Didn't care for it. 
This is a very critical thinking game and the player should be very computer savvy to play.
try to have not so linnear
very simple with clicking pictures or a link in order to progress
It's a lot like the elevator door games that you can download on a phone
The game seems to be near impossible once the hints run out.
I could not get to level 4. Dont be so negative is a negative comment.
Its boring and if youre not smart enough to read the cheats impossible.
The game is ok. 
Could definitely be better.
The game was very interesting but difficult. It required a very abstract style of thinking.
I was getting very frustrated trying to play this game.
yuck
It's too hard for the average joe.
Very hard, time consuming
Some of your links don't work. I couldn't make it past level 5 because your website wasn't authorized to search Google.
Quickly got bored
After the first screen I was stuck and could not continue with no instructions at the beginning of the game
this game was hard for me
Entirely unclear what to do, help was very unhelpful.
I think this game needs to be redone over.
what the hell are you supposed to dio? not obvious to the caasual observer
Could be fun but needs more options/better progressive difficulty.
