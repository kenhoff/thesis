A simpler version of Mousetrap
It can be quite difficult as you move along in the game.
Very boring and unentertaining puzzles.
Very Addictive
I found the game very difficult and confusing. Yes, there was a tutorial, but I did not find it informative at all, and the music was down right annoying.
The fact that you have to allow an unknown publisher full access to your computer in order to play game is an outrage.  
I need to update my computer software so it was having some trouble loading and then kicked me off the webpage before I was able to finish playing.
I was really confused and had no idea how to play the game.
No
improve the graphics
The game was interesting, just because I haven't seen an older game like this in a long time.
it was okay, but i certainly did not learn anything substantial from the game. Any information it was providing me was simply not interesting. 
This was such a unique game
The graphics were poor
None
great
The game would not load. I tried multiple times and it wouldn't do anything. It just said "The Incredible Machine may take a few moments to load". 
i hated it
this is not a game for me.
It was an old school DOS game. Mildly fun.
The required applet to load by an unknown publisher almost made me not play. 
good game.
