Sim City, Metal Gear Solid (more on ethics), Assassin's Creed (not historically accurate but makes history interesting, and by extension learning about history). God of war (same reasons as mentioned for AssCreed). For a short summary of learning via interest, I suggest googling the web series "Extra Credits" and the specific episode is "Tangential Learning"
