functions

// code
function foo() {
	bar();
	print('foo');
}
function bar() {
	print('bar');
}

for print('fizz'), write "fizz" (no quotes) in the text box. for print('fizz') followed later in the program by print('buzz'), write "fizzbuzz" in the text box.

questions: 4 pre, 4 post. random permutations of 4 foo or bar function calls strung together.

ex:

foo()
bar()
bar()
foo()

or:

bar()
bar()
bar()
bar()



loops

using 2 of the following questions for pre and the other 2 for post

4. Examine the following code:
    int count = 0;                                  
    while ( count <= 6 )  
    {
      System.out.print( count + " " );
      count = count + 2; 
    }
    System.out.println(  );
What does this code print on the monitor?
a. 1 2 3 4 5 6
b. 0 2 4 6 8
c. 0 2 4
d. 0 2 4 6

5. Examine the following code:
    int count = 7;                                  
    while ( count >= 4 )  
    {
      System.out.print( count + " " );
      count = count - 1; 
    }
    System.out.println(  );
What does this code print on the monitor?
a. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
b. 7 6 5 4
c. 6 5 4 3
d. 7 6 5 4 3

6. Examine the following code:
    int count = -2 ;                                  
    while ( count < 3 )  
    {
      System.out.print( count + " " );
      count = count + 1; 
    }
    System.out.println(  );
What does this code print on the monitor?
a. -2 -1 1 2 3 4
b. -2 -1 1 2 3
c. -3 -4 -5 -6 -7
d. -2 -1 0 1 2

7. Examine the following code:
    int count =  1;                                  
    while ( count < 5 )  
    {
      System.out.print( count + " " );
    }
    System.out.println(  );
What does this code print on the monitor?
a. 1 2 3 4
b. 1 2 3 4 5
c. 2 3 4
d. 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 . . . .


conditionals


procedural generation
X: for each instance, randomly choose between True or False
%%: for each instance, randomly choose between 'and' or 'or'
#: for each instance, randomly choose between 'not' or blank

format:
#(#X %% #X) %% #(#X %% #X)

for pre and post, generate 4 questions each

Does this conditional evaluate to True or False? (multiple choice)
