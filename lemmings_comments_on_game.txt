Very fun 
Perhaps a tutorial before starting the game would make it easier to comprehend what is needed

I like Lemmings games. They are cute, and there are numerous avenues to solving most puzzles. This encourages players to be creative instead of looking over and over for the one and only solution to a problem.
I've known this game since I was a child, has always been fun but not so sure on the educational part.

Instructions were unclear. I could not figure out the premise of the game, nor how to effectively proceed.
the game was confusing, and there was no\where to find instructions, so I really didn't know what I was doing. 
very boring almost irritating 
Nothing 
I think it should give some tougher rolls like switch up what kind of lemmings to use.
It sucks.
Graphics need to be updated. 
Action
Fun little game

The website it very slow.

good
Its an old game, built on the process of trail and error to solve the puzzles. The Lemmings are simple creatures you have little control over, but what you do has a big impact. 
Great old game.  Needs little improvement -- classic.  I enjoy the relatively quick-paced problem solving required. 
I like how it looks the little characters but no instructions on how to play !
