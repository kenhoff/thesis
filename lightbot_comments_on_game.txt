Interesting game
no idea what to do
The game is excellent beyond belief 
Had trouble loading from site
a simple puzzle game, easy but fun
how to shoot people and ran away
i felt game was boring
It was cool.
Interesting game.
Very interesting for who is studying Computer Science
I enjoyed this game quite abit, it didn't feel like I was learning programming at all. 
None
It would be nice if you could get a description of each square by hovering over it with your mouse. 
it was fun but it was easy
Nothing.  Found it rather boring and plain
I could not access the game.
Definitely just for the kids.
did not like..kept freezing up
nothing at all
I think the game should offer a help option directly on the puzzle as well.
It was a good game, a little basic, but solid. 
Its a good way to introduce functionality and programming to a new audience
It took me a while to figure out you need to use the lightbulb command on the blue squares
graphics were okay, load up took long, but that smy computer. verall it was okay. just not what im intrested in.
interesting but a bit dull.
game lagged and was kind of slow and boring at times.
Simple and intuitive. 
great
the games takes very long time for loading and irritated a lot
the game was terrible and annoying
