\maketitle

\section{Very Important stuff}
Here is my text, including the \LaTeX\ symbol.
\subsection{Important stuff}
More text here.
\subsubsection{Less Important stuff}
And even more text.
\paragraph{Trivial stuff}
Note that the text starts on the same line as the paragraph heading.
\subparagraph{Mind-numbingly inconsequential stuff}

Even if you skip lines.

Just skipping a line starts a new paragraph.

\noindent You can avoid an indent by using the \textbf{{$\mathbf \backslash$}noindent} command.

\section*{Very Important stuff with no number}
Here is my text, including the \LaTeX\ symbol.

	\subsection*{Important stuff with no number}
	Note neither the indent nor the blank line affects the output.

		\subsubsection*{Less Important stuff with no number} The text
		can even begin on the same line.

			\paragraph*{Why bother?}
			Note the indenting in the source file doesn't
				show up in the output, so it's for your
			benefit only.
				\subparagraph*{Mind-numbingly inconsequential stuff}
				Note which types of headings get numbered and/or highlighted.

				Just skipping a line starts a new paragraph.
